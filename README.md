## Introduction: What is GIT?

Git is a free and open-source distributed version control system (VCS), which is designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

# Introduction 

Here is a video introduction:

[![Git Tutorial for Beginners](http://img.youtube.com/vi/pBy1zgt0XPc/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBy1zgt0XPc)



### What is a VCS?

A version control system is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. 

## GitHub

GitHub is a web platform for collaborative software development using version control, enabling developers to manage and share code, track changes, and work together on projects.

## Why Git?

Git is like a time machine for your code. It helps you keep track of changes you make, lets multiple people work on the same project without messing up each other's work, and makes it easy to go back in time if you make a mistake.

## What is a repository?

A repository (repo for short) is a place where your project files and their history live. It's like a folder for your project that Git can track and help you manage. Repositories start out empty - you add your initial project files and begin tracking and committing changes. 

## Creating a repository

Open GitHub.com and click the + icon in the top right corner and select "New repository". Give your repository a name, optionally add a description, choose if you want it public or private, and select whether to initialize the repository with a README file.


## Installing Git

To use Git on your local machine, you need to first install it.

### On Linux

On Linux, you can install Git through your distribution's package manager:

```bash
# Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt install git

# Fedora 
sudo dnf install git

# Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S git
```


### On MacOS
On macOS, you can install Git through Homebrew:
```
brew install git
```
### On Windows
On Windows, you can download the installer from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/download/win)

## Configuring Git
Once Git is installed, you need to configure your name and email to associate with commits:
```
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your@email.com"
```

## Cloning a repository

Cloning a repository copies the entire history of the project. It downloads a project and its entire code history. This is useful if you want to contribute to an existing project or want to use a project as a starting point for your own idea. 


Cloning a repository copies the entire project history locally. This allows you to contribute back to the project or use it as a starting point for your own idea.

To clone a repository from GitHub:

1. Navigate to the repository you want to clone on GitHub.

2. Click on the green **Code** button.

3. Copy the HTTPS or SSH clone URL.

4. Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository. 

5. Run the `git clone` command with the copied URL:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/user/repo.git
```


### Forking a repository 

Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project. Most commonly, forks are used to either propose changes to someone else's project or to use someone else's project as a starting point for your own idea.

Forking a repository also lets you contribute back to the original without having to ask for write access.


## Navigating the Project

Once you have cloned a Git repository, you can navigate through the project directory using Bash commands like `cd` and `ls`.

For example:

```bash
# Change to the project directory 
cd my-project

# List files in current directory
ls 

# Change to src subdirectory
cd src

# List files in src dir
ls

# Go back up to project root
cd ..

# List all files recursively 
ls -R

```

The main commands for navigation are:
*
cd - Change directory
ls - List files and directories 
pwd - Print working directory 
cd .. - Go up one directory 
.  - Current directory 
cd folder - Go into folder from current directory
*
## DO THE MODIFICATIONS

## Here is the git command to push code to GitHub:
## Pushing Code to GitHub

To start, you'll need to commit your changes locally first before pushing to GitHub. 

Stage your changes:

```bash
git add .
```

This adds all modified files to the staging area to be committed.

Commit the changes:
```
git commit -m "Add initial features"
```

This commits the staged changes with the given commit message.

Now you can push your local commits to GitHub:
```
git push origin main
```

This will push the local main branch to the main branch on the remote GitHub repository.

## Creating GitHub Branches

Branches allow you to develop features isolated from each other. The `main` branch is the default branch and contains production-ready code.

To create a new branch:

```bash
git checkout -b new-branch
``` 
This creates a new branch called "new-branch" and switches to it.

Make commits to the new branch locally

Then push the branch to GitHub:
```
git push origin new-branch
```
Here are some explanations of common Git commands that could be useful:
## Git Command Summary

### git clone
- Clones a repository into a new directory. 
- Allows you to get a local copy of a remote repository from services like GitHub.
- Usage: `git clone https://github.com/user/repo.git`

### git add
- Stages changed files to be committed. 
- You need to add files to the staging area before committing.
- Usage: `git add file.txt`

### git commit
- Commits staged changes to the local repository with a message. 
- Commits should be made in logical units.
- Usage: `git commit -m "Implement new feature"`

### git push
- Pushes local commits to the remote repository like GitHub. 
- Updates the remote with your local changes.
- Usage: `git push origin main` 

### git pull
- Pulls latest commits from the remote repository and merges into your local branch.
- Keeps your local copy in sync.  
- Usage: `git pull origin main`

### git branch
- Lists all local branches. Can also create a new branch.
- Usage: `git branch new-feature`

### git checkout
- Switches to a different branch. Detaches HEAD to that branch.
- Usage: `git checkout new-feature`

## What is a README.md File 
A README.md file is a text file that provides information about a software project. It is written in Markdown format and usually included in the root directory of a project.

Some common sections in a README.md file:

Project title and description - A brief overview of what the project is and does.

Installation instructions - Steps to install the required dependencies and get the project running locally.

Usage - Examples of how to use the software and its features.

Contributing - Guidelines on how others can contribute to the project.

License - Open source license for the project.

Credits/attributions - Recognize contributors, libraries used, tutorials followed etc.

Contact info - Ways to get in touch with the maintainer.
